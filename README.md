# eVital

eVital gets up-to-date daily data about our vitals from wearable technology and mobile health and sends that data to our family doctors, practitioners or caregivers so that they can monitor our health. eVital also allows for seamless communication and monitoring by allowing doctors to assign tasks and prescriptions and to monitor this information through the app.

## Inspiration

Our inspiration for this project was the technological and communication gap between healthcare professionals and patients, restricted access to both oneâ€™s own health data and physicians, misdiagnosis due to lack of historical information, as well as rising demand in distance-healthcare due to the lack of physicians in rural areas and increasing patient medical home practices. Time is of the essence in the field of medicine, and we hope to save time, energy, money and empower self-care for both healthcare professionals and patients by automating standard vitals measurement, providing simple data visualization and communication channels.
